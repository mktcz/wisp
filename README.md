# Wisp

**A Lighter, Simpler Go Development Runner**

Wisp is a minimalist, file-watching and live-reloading command-line tool designed for modern Go development. It automatically rebuilds and restarts your application(s) when file changes are detected, with support for running multiple services concurrently.

## Features

- **Concurrent App Runner**: Run multiple applications simultaneously from a single configuration
- **Intelligent File Watching**: Debounced file change detection prevents build spam
- **Reliable Process Control**: Strict lifecycle management (kill ‚Üí wait ‚Üí build ‚Üí run)
- **TOML Configuration**: Clean, simple configuration format
- **Targeted Commands**: Run all apps or specific ones
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling and cleanup
- **Smart Delays**: Configurable delays between operations to ensure reliability

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/mktcz/wisp@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mktcz/wisp.git
cd wisp
go build -o wisp .
sudo cp wisp /usr/local/bin/wisp
```

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize a sample configuration:**

   ```bash
   wisp init
   ```

2. **Customize `wisp.toml` for your project:**

   ```toml
   # API Server
   [api]
     run_cmd = "/tmp/api-server"
     build_cmd = "go build -o /tmp/api-server ./cmd/api"
     watch_dir = "./cmd/api"
     env = { PORT = "8080" }

   # Background Worker
   [worker]
     run_cmd = "/tmp/worker"
     build_cmd = "go build -o /tmp/worker ./cmd/worker"
     watch_dir = "./cmd/worker"
     env = { QUEUE_PROVIDER = "redis" }
   ```

3. **Run your applications:**

   ```bash
   # Run all applications
   wisp

   # Run a specific application
   wisp run api
   ```
